## Installation

After setting up my repo, the first action item I tackled was creating the file structure. Once that was complete, I moved on to installing the npm package- [idb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb). To install the package, I typed the following into the command line:
```
 npm i idb
 ```

Then to start the server, I typed the following command:
```
npm start
```

And to run and build the webpack, I typed the following commands:

```
npx webpack; npm run build
```

After I did that, the "dist" folder was created. Within that folder, several files were created as well, including an index.html, install.bundle.js, main.bundle.js, manifest.json, and a src-sw.js.
